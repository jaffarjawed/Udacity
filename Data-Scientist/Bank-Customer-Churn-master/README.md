# Bank-Customer-Churn
<h1> Project Motivation </h1>

<p> 
  Based on Cross-Industry Standard Process of Data Mining (CRISP-DM), Bank churn modelling dataset is used which is initially hosted on kaggel platform. Three bisinuess questions were asked and answered:
  </p>
  
 <ul>
  <li>Question 1: Which gender has highest churning rate and are they active member or inactive member?</li>
  <li>
Question 2: Which customer has higher churning rate one who uses our services like credit card or one who not uses services frequently?</li>
  <li>Question 3: Is there any relation between age and tenure time? </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h1> File description</h1>
  <ul>
  <li>A Descriptive jupyter notebook</li>
  <li> One dataset for builiding the model (Churn_Modelling.csv)</li>
  </ul>
  <h1> Requirements</h1>
  <ul>
  <li>  TEnsorflow</li>
   <li> Keras</li>
   <li> SK Learn</li>
   <li> Pandas</li>
   <li> Numpy</li>
  <li>Matplotlib </li>
  </ul>
  <h1> Result of the analysis </h1>
  <p> Results and discussion were published on Medium: <a href = 'https://medium.com/@jaffarjawed/predicting-preventing-banking-customer-churn-by-machine-learning-ee17eee32256'>Predicting & Preventing Banking Customer Churn by Machine Learning </a></p> <br>
  <p> In this project, I dived into the most recent Bank Customer Churn Modelling  and found many interesting phenomenom: </p>
   <ul>
  <li>We gathered the Bank Churn Modelling dataset and did some preprocessing of the dataset</li>
  <li>
We established a machine learning model to predict the churning of the customers and found various interesting facts.</li>
  <li>We took a look at the feature importance of the trained model and check if they make sense.</li>
  <li>We list all the important amenities to get a better feeling how bank manager or owner can  provide better services to meet customersâ€™ need so that churning of the customer could decrease.</li>
  </ul>
